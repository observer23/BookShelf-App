# BookShelf-App
An online shelf for your books.



A simple book listing app.

- VIPER Pattern,
- There is none 3rd Party library or SwiftUI,
- API which is given to me,
- Used CoreData,
- Filtering by date,favourites,
- Searching by letter,
- Display "isFav" ? 
- Directing to Safari for more information.
